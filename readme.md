## Minimalistic bem code for plane wave scattering from soft targets 
### MM 3.8.2025

mm-bem contains collection of several source codes for calculating scattering pattern obtained when plane wave scatters from soft targets. It uses boundary element method with piecewise constant discontinuous finite elements in 3D (P0).

Calling convension depends on the code language but usually it uses four parameters:

1. mesh file name in msh ascii 2.2 format (defaults to sphere-1.905-600.msh representing 1.905cm radius sphere defined with 600 points and 1196 triangles)
2. direction angle (defaults to $$\theta$$ = 0 what means that it travels along x axis)
3. frequency (defaults to $$f$$ = 38kHz)
4. sound speed (defaults $$c$$ = 1480m/s)

The most often results are printed into standard output in the form of two-column data containing:

1. scattering angle in degrees 
2. absolute value of scattering length.  

This output data could be redirected to txt file or piped to plotting software. The polar scattering strength in logarithmic domain could be obtained by gnuplot polar.gp script. The target strength is the value calculated at  $$180^{\circ}$$ distance from wave direction angle. 

The source codes are in C, Python, Matlab, Julia and FreeFem. The theoretical calculations for a soft sphere are in Gnuplot. The example results are for 38kHz. The usege of source codes requires installating its evironments or comilers. Only FreeFem version uses Hmatrix approach that allows for faster calculations for large meshes. 

The package contains also the demonstration page that do not need any addition installation. The page allows generating sphere, spheroid or ellipsoid meshes and calculate scattering pattern for them. Moreover, it can present the results in polar form of calculated data along with other data file that could be added for comparison.
